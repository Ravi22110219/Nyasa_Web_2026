          The word Nyasa means 'trust' in Sanskrit. At the Indian Institute of Technology,
          Gandhinagar, this word implies extending our trustworthy help to the little eyes
          that dream of a better life under their temporary thatched huts.

          NYASA, started in 2011, primarily aims to support and educate the children of migrant
          construction workers in and around the campus. Our collective strength 'education'
          is used as a platform to bring children from dusty environs to an open-air school,
          provide them with mid-day meals and fruits for good health, and basic education on campus.
