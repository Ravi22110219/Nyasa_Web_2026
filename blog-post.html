                When I joined IIT Gandhinagar in 2022 as a first-year Civil Engineering student, I was excited about
                academics, campus life, and new opportunities. Like many freshers, I was exploring where I belonged
                outside classrooms — something that would give meaning to my college journey beyond grades and
                assignments.
                That search led me to Nyasa, and unknowingly, it became one of the most defining parts of my IIT life.
              </p>

              <p>
                Looking back today, from my first step as a volunteer to becoming the Communication Team Coordinator in
                my
                fourth year, Nyasa has shaped not just my skills but also my perspective towards society,
                responsibility,
                leadership, and empathy.

                <h2>First Year: Beginning as a Volunteer – Discovering Ground Reality</h2>
              </div>

              <p>
                In my very first year at IIT Gandhinagar, I joined the Nyasa Chetana Program as a volunteer.
                At that time, I did not know how deeply this decision would impact me. Chetana focuses on
                providing education to construction workers' children and children from nearby villages such
                as Palaj and Basan.
              </p>

              <div class="insight-box">
                <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Teaching isn't just about transferring knowledge—it's about connecting with each student's unique
                  learning journey.</p>
              </div>

              <p>
                I started teaching Hindi and Music. Initially, I thought teaching would simply mean going there,
                completing lessons, and returning. But very quickly, I realized that it was much more than that.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-box">
                <p>"Their excitement to learn even basic concepts made me appreciate the privilege of education I had
                  always taken for granted."</p>
              </div>

              <div class="stats-box">
                <div class="stat-item">

                </div>
              </div>

              <p>
                Music classes were especially special. It was not just about songs — it became a space where
                children expressed themselves, relaxed, and connected. Over time, I started understanding their
                backgrounds, struggles, and dreams.
              </p>

              <p class="section-conclusion">
                <strong>Takeaway:</strong> That first year gave me something priceless — ground-level understanding
                of social outreach. It changed how I saw education, opportunity, and responsibility.

                <h2>Second Year: Deeper Involvement – Expanding My Contribution</h2>
              </div>

              <p>
                In my second year, my connection with Nyasa became stronger. I continued volunteering in Chetana,
                but this time with more confidence and responsibility. I started understanding how programs are
                planned, how logistics are managed, and how consistent engagement is maintained.
              </p>

              <p>
                Along with Chetana, I also volunteered in the Sanjeevani initiative. Through this, I got exposure
                to another dimension of social outreach — health awareness and support activities.
              </p>

              <div class="learning-box">
                <h4><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> What I Learned</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Program planning and logistics management</li>

              </div>

              <p>
                This phase was important because I moved from being someone who just participated to someone who
                started thinking about impact, sustainability, and continuity of initiatives.

              </div>

              <p>
                In my third year, I joined the Nyasa Organising Team. This was a major transition. Instead of only
                working on field-level activities, I moved into backend operations — specifically Social Media and
                Website Team.
              </p>

              </div>

              <p>
                This role opened a completely new dimension for me. I learned how communication shapes outreach,
                how digital presence increases impact, how storytelling helps social initiatives reach more people,
                and how documentation preserves the work done by volunteers.

                In my fourth year, I took on the role of Communication Team Coordinator. This was both exciting

                coordination, and long-term communication strategy.

                It was truly great working with Ravi during our time in the Nyasa team. I have seen his dedication and
                sincerity towards both the work and the people we worked for. From managing responsibilities to
                supporting team members, he always maintained a calm and solution-oriented approach. His journey from
                volunteer to Communication Team Coordinator is very well deserved. Wishing him the best for everything
